# ERSmeta: A Metadata schema to describe energy research software

ERSmeta is a metadata schema designed to facilitate the discovery, sharing, and reuse of energy research software. The schema provides a standardized way to describe the metadata associated with energy research software, including its purpose, functionality, and usage.

ERSmeta is based on [CodeMeta](https://codemeta.github.io) and also reuses elements from [metadata4ing](http://w3id.org/nfdi4ing/metadata4ing#), [the open energy ontology (OEO)](	http://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/), [the Software Description Ontology](https://w3id.org/okn/o/sd), and [ontosoft](http://ontosoft.org/software#).

## Provided Formats

ERSmeta is provided in two formats:

#### Shacl
A **shacl formalization** can be found  as [turtle file](https://github.com/NFDI4Energy/ERSmeta/blob/main/ERSmeta.ttl). It contains all constrains of the metadata schema.

#### JSON-LD
TBD

## Documentation
A **general description** of the metadata schema can be found on its [documentation website](https://nfdi4energy.github.io/ERSmeta/). The documentation is build from the SHACL formalization.
Also, a [description of all properties](https://github.com/NFDI4Energy/ERSmeta/blob/main/properties_description.csv) and [a description of all used types (and their properties)](https://github.com/NFDI4Energy/ERSmeta/blob/main/type_descriptions.csv) is provided in this repository.
